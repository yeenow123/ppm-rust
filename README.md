# ppm-rust

This is an implementation of the PPM image file format.  The goal was to learn about the PPM file format, as well as improve my Rust skills.

I used the following resources to learn about PPM:

http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/ppm.html

http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/ppm/

https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~soni/cs35/f13/Labs/extras/01/ppm_info.html

## Usage

```bash
cargo run [IMAGE_FILENAME]
```
